# match an HTML tag:
 Regular expressions, also known as regex, are a powerful tool used to match patterns in text. They are widely used in programming, text editors, and command line tools to search, replace, and manipulate text data. A regular expression is essentially a string of characters that defines a search pattern. This pattern can be used to match specific text, such as email addresses or phone numbers, or to extract information from unstructured data, such as log files or web pages. Regular expressions can be complex and intimidating at first, but with a little practice, they can become a valuable tool in your data analysis and manipulation arsenal. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of regular expressions, including syntax, patterns, and examples of how to use them in various programming languages.

## Regex Components
    <([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*)\b[^>]*>(.*?)<\/\1>
### Anchors
    Anchors: This pattern does not use anchors, which are special characters that match the beginning or end of a line or string.
### Quantifiers
    Quantifiers: This pattern uses the * quantifier, which matches zero or more occurrences of the previous character or group. It is used to match the tag name and any attributes that may be present.
### OR Operator
    OR Operator: This pattern does not use the OR operator, which is represented by the pipe character (|) and allows you to match one pattern or another.
### Character Classes
    Character Classes: This pattern uses the character class [a-zA-Z0-9], which matches any uppercase or lowercase letter or digit. It is used to match the tag name.
### Flags
    Flags: This pattern does not use any flags, which are optional settings that modify how the pattern behaves, such as case sensitivity and global matching.
### Grouping and Capturing
    Grouping and Capturing: This pattern uses capturing groups to match the tag name and the content between the opening and closing tags. The tag name is captured in group 1 and is used to ensure that the closing tag matches the opening tag.
### Bracket Expressions
    Bracket Expressions: This pattern uses the brackets [ and ] to define a character class. It is used to match letters and digits in the tag name.
### Greedy and Lazy Match
    Greedy and Lazy Match: This pattern uses a lazy match, denoted by the ? character, to match the content between the opening and closing tags. This ensures that the pattern stops matching as soon as it encounters the closing tag, rather than continuing to match until the last closing tag in the document.
### Boundaries
    Boundaries: This pattern does not use any boundaries, which are special characters that match the beginning or end of a word or line.
### Back-references
    Back-references: This pattern uses a back-reference to match the closing tag that corresponds to the opening tag. The \1 notation refers back to the content matched by group 1, which should be the tag name.
### Look-ahead and Look-behind
    Look-ahead and Look-behind: This pattern does not use look-ahead or look-behind assertions, which are special syntax that allow you to match patterns that are followed by or preceded by certain other patterns, without including those patterns in the match itself.
